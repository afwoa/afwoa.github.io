&lt;p&gt;If you intend to submit an application in an upcoming cycle, these are the things you should push as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AF Form 422&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="af-form-422"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="#af-form-422" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AF Form 422 is used to provide a snapshot of your current medical status. This document can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to obtain, and acts as a blocker to other processes, so it is imperative that you get this done as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AF422 is valid for 1 year (??) and must have a very specific statement as determined by the board. As of the FY26 board, the statement was as follows. Please ensure it has not changed for the current board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Based on full record review, the member is medically qualified for continued enlistment, commissioning, cleared for worldwide duty, and does not have an ALC or in the process of a medical evaluation board (MEB). Also, member doe not have an AF Form 460. Duty Limiting Condition Report, describing duty limitation or exemption from any component for Fitness Testing. Mamber has/has not has PRK or Lasik surgery. Surgery date was: MM/DD/YYYY.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0"&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Send an email to the aforementioned email address with something along the following. Ensure you update the required verbiage as necessary per AF Accessions instructions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;I have submitted a request for an AF 422 and am requesting the following verbiage:
Based on full record review, the member is medically qualified for continued enlistment or commissioning, is cleared for wordwide duty, and does not have an Assignment Limitation Code (ALC), nor are they in the process of a Medical Evaluation Board (MEB). Also, the member does not have an AF Form 469 (Duty Limiting Condition Report) describing duty limitations or exemption from any component for Fitness Testing.
Member has had PRK/LASIK surgery. Surgery date was MM/DD/YYYY.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0"&gt;
&lt;button
class="hextra-code-copy-btn hx-group/copybtn hx-transition-all active:hx-opacity-50 hx-bg-primary-700/5 hx-border hx-border-black/5 hx-text-gray-600 hover:hx-text-gray-900 hx-rounded-md hx-p-1.5 dark:hx-bg-primary-300/10 dark:hx-border-white/10 dark:hx-text-gray-400 dark:hover:hx-text-gray-50"
title="Copy code"
&gt;
&lt;div class="copy-icon group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-hidden hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="success-icon hx-hidden group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-block hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Readiness Team may respond to this email requesting this verbiage be requested via MHS Genesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the &lt;code&gt;IMR&lt;/code&gt; tab for an &lt;code&gt;AF422&lt;/code&gt; link daily. This is where your AF422 will be found and you may not recieve any notification that it is ready for download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your AF422 will need to be valid through WOTS graduation, and as such, you may need to re-request it as you get closer to your WOTS class date after you have been initially selected. The process should be identical at that point. If you show up to WOTS with an expired AF422, you will be sent home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AFCEP Request&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="afcep-request"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="#afcep-request" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have all documents completed, you will upload them via a website called AFCEP. It can be a bit of a time consuming hassle to get access to AFCEP, so it is highly recommended that you begin the process of requesting an account as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information coming soon&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Training Record&lt;span class="hx-absolute -hx-mt-20" id="training-record"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="#training-record" class="subheading-anchor" aria-label="Permalink for this section"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please know and ensure your training records are up to date in the various systems of record. Don&amp;rsquo;t meet the requirements, fail to have it reflected properly, and get passed over because of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to workrole certifications, ensure that Talent Marketplace has an up to date list of all training, certifications, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>1.
