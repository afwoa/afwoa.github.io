This document can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to obtain, and acts as a blocker to other processes, so it is imperative that you get this done as soon as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The AF422 is valid for 1 year (??) and must have a very specific statement as determined by the board. As of the FY26 board, the statement was as follows. Please ensure it has not changed for the current board.&lt;/p>
