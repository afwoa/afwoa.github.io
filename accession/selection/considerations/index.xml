&lt;p&gt;It appears that generally speaking, WO selects are being assigned where they are currently stationed, however, it is highly dependant on the &amp;ldquo;Needs of the Air Force&amp;rdquo; and will not be the case for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assignment availability can be seen in AMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once assignments have started to load, you can see if you have any by using the EFMP trick described below: (Or click &lt;a href="https://cms.us.af.mil/PPAEFMPNet40/Pages/ApplyCC.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; until it actually loads)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the &lt;a href="https://vmpf.us.af.mi;/vMPFNet40/Hub.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vMPF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select &lt;a href="https://vmpf.us.af.mil/vMPFNet40/Assignments/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Assignments&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;a href="https://cms.us.af.mil/PPAEFMPNet40/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Exceptional Family Member Program Application&lt;/a&gt; from the menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select &lt;a href="https://cms.us.af.mil/PPAEFMPNet40/Pages/ApplyCC.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Apply to Change or Cancel Assignment, Travel of EFMP Family Member Non-Recommended&lt;/a&gt; from the sidebar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do NOT have orders, it will say &amp;ldquo;The system of record (MilPDS) does not show that you have a projected assignment&amp;rdquo;. Otherwise, you do. This trick, however, will not show you were you have orders to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select &lt;a href="https://cms.us.af.mil/PPAEFMPNet40/Pages/ApplyRemove.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Remove my EMFP application&lt;/a&gt; from the sidebar to fully cancel the application.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Constructive Service Credit and follow on location have been determined, a class date will be chosen for you. You may reach out to request a specific class if you have substantial reason to, but this process is very much so &amp;ldquo;Needs of the Air Force&amp;rdquo; and you may not have much if a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do have a substantial reason to request a specific class, it is helpful to request it at the same time you submit your Post-Selection Package.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Constructive Service Credit</title><link>https://afwoa.com/accession/selection/considerations/csc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://afwoa.com/accession/selection/considerations/csc/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;Once you have been selected to become a Warrant Officer, your prior service will be evaluated to make a determination as to where you will enter the Warrant Officer ranks. This process is known as &amp;ldquo;Constructive Service Credit&amp;rdquo; assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Constructive Service Credit process takes approximately one month, and plays a large part in your class number. The YY-01 class will be filled with the remaining members of the prior year&amp;rsquo;s selectees. YY-02 will be filled with those who did not have enough CSC to make W-2. YY-03 is the first class that will have W-2&amp;rsquo;s (as well as OCONUS members). YY-04 will have the remaining W-2&amp;rsquo;s. Obviously emergencies and other critical factors may vary this on a case by case basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information coming soon&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Finances</title><link>https://afwoa.com/accession/selection/considerations/finances/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://afwoa.com/accession/selection/considerations/finances/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;After being selected for WOTS, you will be expected spend a significant amount of money on uniforms/etc. There are ways to be compensated for some of this cost which will be described here.&lt;/p&gt;
