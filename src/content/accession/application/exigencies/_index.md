If you intend to submit an application in an upcoming cycle, these are the things you should push as early as possible.

## AF Form 422

The AF Form 422 is used to provide a snapshot of your current medical status. This document can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to obtain, and acts as a blocker to other processes, so it is imperative that you get this done as soon as possible.

The AF422 is valid for 1 year (??) and must have a very specific statement as determined by the board. As of the FY26 board, the statement was as follows. Please ensure it has not changed for the current board. 

```
Based on full record review, the member is medically qualified for continued enlistment, commissioning, cleared for worldwide duty, and does not have an ALC or in the process of a medical evaluation board (MEB). Also, member doe not have an AF Form 460. Duty Limiting Condition Report, describing duty limitation or exemption from any component for Fitness Testing. Mamber has/has not has PRK or Lasik surgery. Surgery date was: MM/DD/YYYY.
```

## AFCEP Request
