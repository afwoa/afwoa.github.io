If you intend to submit an application in an upcoming cycle, these are the things you should push as early as possible.

## AF Form 422

The AF Form 422 is used to provide a snapshot of your current medical status. This document can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to obtain, and acts as a blocker to other processes, so it is imperative that you get this done as soon as possible.

The AF422 is valid for 1 year (??) and must have a very specific statement as determined by the board. As of the FY26 board, the statement was as follows. Please ensure it has not changed for the current board. 

```
```

To request an AF Form 422, do the following:
1. Go to myIMR
2. Go to the Medical Clearance tab and click Start New Medical Clearance Request
3. More steps coming soon... 

## AFCEP Request

Once you have all documents completed, you will upload them via a website called AFCEP. It can be a bit of a time consuming hassle to get access to AFCEP, so it is highly recommended that you begin the process of requesting an account as early as possible.

More information coming soon...
