title: Constructive Service Credit
---

Once you have been selected to become a Warrant Officer, your prior service will be evaluated to make a determination as to where you will enter the Warrant Officer ranks. This process is known as "Constructive Service Credit" assessment.

The Constructive Service Credit process takes approximately one month, and plays a large part in your class number. The YY-01 class will be filled with the remaining members of the prior year's selectees. YY-02 will be filled with those who did not have enough CSC to make W-2. YY-03 is the first class that will have W-2's (as well as OCONUS members). YY-04 will have the remaining W-2's. Obviously emergencies and other critical factors may vary this on a case by case basis.
