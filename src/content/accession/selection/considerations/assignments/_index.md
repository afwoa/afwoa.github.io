It appears that generally speaking, WO selects are being assigned where they are currently stationed, however, it is highly dependant on the "Needs of the Air Force" and will not be the case for everyone.

Assignment availability can be seen in AMS. 

Once assignments have started to load, you can see if you have any by using the EFMP trick described below: (Or click [this link](https://cms.us.af.mil/PPAEFMPNet40/Pages/ApplyCC.aspx) until it actually loads)
1. Go to the [vMPF](https://vmpf.us.af.mi;/vMPFNet40/Hub.aspx).
1. Select [Assignments](https://vmpf.us.af.mil/vMPFNet40/Assignments/Default.aspx) -> [Exceptional Family Member Program Application](https://cms.us.af.mil/PPAEFMPNet40/Default.aspx) from the menu.
1. Select [Apply to Change or Cancel Assignment, Travel of EFMP Family Member Non-Recommended](https://cms.us.af.mil/PPAEFMPNet40/Pages/ApplyCC.aspx) from the sidebar.
1. If you do NOT have orders, it will say "The system of record (MilPDS) does not show that you have a projected assignment". Otherwise, you do. This trick, however, will not show you were you have orders to.
1. Select [Remove my EMFP application](https://cms.us.af.mil/PPAEFMPNet40/Pages/ApplyRemove.aspx) from the sidebar to fully cancel the application.
