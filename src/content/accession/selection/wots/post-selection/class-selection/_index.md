After Constructive Service Credit and follow on location have been determined, a class date will be chosen for you. You may reach out to request a specific class if you have substantial reason to, but this process is very much so "Needs of the Air Force" and you may not have much if a choice.

If you do have a substantial reason to request a specific class, it is helpful to request it at the same time you submit your Post-Selection Package.
